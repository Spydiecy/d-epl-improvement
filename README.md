# Football Manager System

This project implements a football manager system, allowing users to manage various aspects of a football team, including players, matches, tactics, and more.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally and test its functionality, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Replica:**
   Run the following command to start the replica, running in the background:
   ```
   dfx start --background
   ```

2. **Deploy Canisters:**
   Deploy your canisters to the replica and generate your candid interface using:
   ```
   dfx deploy
   ```
   Once the deployment job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

3. **Generate Candid Interface (if Backend Changes):**
   If you make changes to your backend canister, generate a new candid interface with:
   ```
   npm run generate
   ```
   This is recommended before starting the frontend development server.

4. **Start Frontend Development Server (for Frontend Changes):**
   If you are making frontend changes, start a development server with:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

## Note on Frontend Environment Variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- Set `DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack.
- Use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations.
- Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override` to a string in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the specified string in the autogenerated declarations.

## Custom createActor Constructor

If needed, you can write your own `createActor` constructor for custom configuration or environment variables setup.
